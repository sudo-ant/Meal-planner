## Shopping list logic

The app uses a hybrid approach.

It sums clear quantities such as:

- mugs of rice
- tins of beans
- grams of turkey mince
- eggs
- chicken breasts
- frozen vegetable mugs

It keeps items grouped by Continente-style sections such as Meat, Frozen, Dry goods, Tinned goods, Dairy, Eggs and Seasoning.

## Deployment

Upload the folder contents to a GitHub Pages repository.

For best results, keep the data files at:

```text
data/recipes.json
data/plans.json
```

## Editing recipes

Edit `data/recipes.json`.

Each recipe needs:

- id
- title
- group
- servings
- tags
- ingredients
- steps

## Editing plans

Edit `data/plans.json`.

Each plan uses recipe IDs from `recipes.json`.
